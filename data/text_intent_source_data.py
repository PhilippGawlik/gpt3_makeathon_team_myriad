        "Suitable detergents",
        "Only use detergents that are suitable for dishwashers. Both separate and combined detergents are suitable.  For optimum washing and drying results, use separate detergent, adding Special salt and Rinse aid separately. Modern, powerful detergents mainly use a low-alkaline formulation with enzymes. Enzymes break down starch and remove protein. Oxygen-based bleaching agents are generally used to remove coloured marks, e.g. tea or ketchup. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for each detergent. Tabs are suitable for all cleaning functions and do not need to be measured out. With shorter Programmes tabs sometimes do not dissolve entirely and leave residues of detergent. This may impair the cleaning effect. Powder detergent is recommended for shorter Programmes . The dosage can be adjusted to the level of soiling. The dosage can be adjusted to the level of soiling. Suitable detergents are available online via our website or from Customer Service ."

        "Arrange tableware",
        "Arrange the tableware correctly to optimise the dishwashing result and prevent damage to both the appliance and tableware. Using the appliance allows you to save energy and water compared to washing-up by hand. See our website for examples of how to load your appliance efficiently, free of charge. To save energy and water, load the machine with the number of place settings specified. For better washing and drying results, position items with curves or recesses at an angle so the water can run off. Remove large remnants of food from your tableware. To save resources, do not pre-rinse tableware under running water. Put heavily soiled tableware in the bottom basket, e.g. pans. The more powerful the spray jet, the better the dishwashing result will be. To prevent damage to tableware, arrange it so it is stable and cannot tip over. To prevent injury, arrange cutlery with the points and sharp edges downwards. Position containers with the openings facing down so no water can collect in them. Do not block the spray arms and  make sure that they can turn freely. Do not place small parts in the tablet collecting tray and do not block it with tableware so as not to obstruct the lid of the detergent dispenser."
